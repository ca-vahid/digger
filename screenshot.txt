Digger Remastered Game Screenshot

The screenshot would show:
- The game grid with tunnels, emeralds, gold bags, and enemies
- The Digger character navigating through the maze
- Particle effects when collecting items
- Teleport portals connecting different parts of the maze
- The score, lives, and level information at the top
